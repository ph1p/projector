This is an application for project managers. To display a structured chart of who is working on which project.
You can add users(employees), projects, units, the know how of each employee and the amount of how many parallel projects a user can have.

## But why?

Use this tool to plan your projects for the current and upcoming years.
It should help you to spread your projects evenly to all users/employees.
This should prevent a user to not work on many projects at the same time.

With this tool you can display all running projects, their involved users and deadlines at once.
